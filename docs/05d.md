Along previous sections, we've been using *static* and *final* words in some parts of our code. It's now time to explain what they exactly mean.

## 1. Static elements

**static** modifier defines elements that belong to the class itself, and not to any specific object of the class. For instance, if we define a static attribute:

```Java
public class MyClass 
{
    static int count = 0;
}
```

Then every object that we create of that class will share this attribute with the rest of the objects of that class. So a static attribute is something like a *shared variable*.

Regarding methods, a static method is a method that can be called without creating any object of the class:

```Java
public class MyClass 
{
    ...
    public static void myMethod() 
    {
        ...
    }

    public void myOtherMethod() 
    {
        ...
    }
}
...
MyClass.myMethod();         // OK
MyClass.myOtherMethod();    // ERROR

MyClass mc = new MyClass();
mc.myMethod();              // OK (but not necessary)
mc.myOtherMethod();         // OK
```

Keep in mind that in a static method you can only use other static elements (attributes or methods), but not any non-static method existing outside of the method. For instance, this could not be done, since `myOtherMethod` is not static:

```Java
public static void myMethod() 
{
    myOtherMethod();
}

public void myOtherMethod() 
{
    ...
}
```

If we want to use this method, then we need to instantiate a `MyClass` object inside the static method, and then call this other method:

```Java
public static void myMethod() 
{
    MyClass mc = new MyClass();
    mc.myOtherMethod();
}

public void myOtherMethod() 
{
    ...
}
```

You can use many other static methods existing in Java. For instance, `Math` class has a lot of them, such as `Math.pow(...)`, or `Math.sqrt(...)`.

### 1.1. Instance elements vs class elements

At the beginning of this unit we've talked about *instance variables* referring to attributes. We can talk about *instance elements* to refer to any element in a class (either an attribute or a method) that belongs to a given object, this is, we need to instantiate an object to use or access this element.

On the other hand, we have *class elements* (either class attributes or methods), this is, elements that don't belong to a particular object, so we don't need to instantiate any object to use them. This is what we get when we use *static* in our classes.

## 2. Final elements

**final** modifier lets us define elements that can't be modified. If we apply this modifier to an attribute or variable, we are defining a constant: the element can't be re-assigned to any other value:

```Java
final int number = 3;

// ERROR
number = 6;
```

We can also apply this modifier to methods, or even classes. If we apply the modifier to a method, we are indicating that this method can't be overriden by any possible child class. Regarding classes, a final class can't be inherited.
