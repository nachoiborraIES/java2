# Getting started

Before starting with Java programming language, you should have some knowledge about what a programming language is, which are the most important programming languages nowadays and how to compile and run a Java program. Here you have some external links to read about it (you may open them in new tabs or windows):

- [Programs, languages and compilers](https://nachoiborraies.github.io/sw/01a.html), in which you'll learn what programs and programming languages are, and how to run them using language translators.
- [First steps with Java](https://nachoiborraies.github.io/sw/01b.html), in which you'll see how to install Java and create your first program.
- [Using Geany](https://nachoiborraies.github.io/sw/02b.html), a simple tool to create and run programs in many languages.
- [Using IntelliJ](https://nachoiborraies.github.io/sw/02d.html), an advanced tool to manage Java projects.
