## Our first "Hello" program

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}
```
</script>

## Things to take into account

- Every public class must have the same name as the source file that contains it
   - *MyClass.java* for previous example
- There should always be (at least) one public class in every Java source file
- *main* in Java starts with lower case
- *String* in Java starts with upper case
- *main* method always has a *String[] args* element between parentheses
