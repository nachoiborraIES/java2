### **Exercises for `if-else` and `switch`**

#### **1. Age Category**
Write a program that asks the user for their age. Use `if-else` statements to determine and display:
- "Child" if the age is less than 13.
- "Teenager" if the age is between 13 and 19.
- "Adult" if the age is 20 or older.

#### **2. Maximum of Three Numbers**
Write a program that takes three numbers as input from the user. Use `if-else` to find and display the largest number among them.

---

#### **3. Leap Year Checker**
Ask the user to enter a year. Use an `if-else` statement to determine if the year is a leap year or not. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

#### **4. Vowel or Consonant**
Write a program that takes a single character input from the user. Use a `switch` statement to check whether the character is a vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) or a consonant. Handle both uppercase and lowercase characters.

---

#### **5. Calculator**
Ask the user to input two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). Use a `switch` statement to perform the corresponding arithmetic operation and display the result. Handle division by zero with an `if-else` check.

---

#### **6. Grade Checker**
Ask the user to input their grade as a percentage (0-100). Use `if-else` to determine and display:
- "A" for grades 90 and above.
- "B" for grades between 80 and 89.
- "C" for grades between 70 and 79.
- "D" for grades between 60 and 69.
- "F" for grades below 60.

---

#### **7. Month Days**
Ask the user to input a number between 1 and 12 representing a month. Use a `switch` statement to print the number of days in that month. Consider February to have 28 days.

---

#### **8. Even or Odd**
Write a program that asks the user for a number. Use an `if-else` statement to check if the number is even or odd and display the result.

---

#### **9. Traffic Light**
Ask the user to input a color (`red`, `yellow`, or `green`). Use a `switch` statement to display:
- "Stop" for red.
- "Get Ready" for yellow.
- "Go" for green.
Handle invalid inputs with a default case.

---

#### **10. Working Hours**
Ask the user for the current hour (0-23). Use `if-else` statements to determine:
- "Morning" if the hour is between 5 and 11.
- "Afternoon" if the hour is between 12 and 17.
- "Evening" if the hour is between 18 and 21.
- "Night" if the hour is between 22 and 4.
