Selective or conditional structures let us choose among different paths in our code depending on a given condition (or conditions) that must be checked. In this document we'll see the selective structures provided by Java.

## 1. The "if" clause

You can use the `if` basic structure to run a piece of code if a given condition is true:

```java
if (age >= 18)
{
    System.out.println("You are old enough");
}
```

Alternatively, you can use `if..else` structure to choose among a given path (determined by a condition) or its opposite:

```java
if (age >= 18)
{
    System.out.println("You are old enough");
}
else
{
    System.out.println("You are not adult yet");
}
```

Finally, if there is more than two paths to choose among, we can join `if .. else if .. else if .. else` structures to choose among several paths depending on the condition relative to each one. Only one path will be chosen.

```java
if (number > 0)
{
    System.out.println("It is positive");
}
else if (number < -10)
{
    System.out.println("It is under -10");
}
else
{
    System.out.println("It is between -10 and 0");
}
```

The condition in each `if` or `else if` clause can be either a simple condition (like the ones shown in previous examples) or a complex condition, joined by logical operators `&&` and/or `||`:

```java
if (age >= 18 && age <= 30)
{
    System.out.println("You are between 18 and 30");
}
```

## 2. The "switch" clause

Besides, there's a `switch` clause that lets us evaluate the value of a simple variable or expression. Each of the possible values of this expression can be represented with a `case` clause. Finally, we can use a `default` case to represent any other possible value that has not been covered by previous *case* clauses. 

The data managed in the `switch` clause must be a primitive type; strings are NOT allowed in early versions of Java (Java 6 and earlier). We need to add a `break` instruction at the end of each *case* to exit the *switch* clause; otherwise, the program keeps running the instruction of next *case* clause. In other languages, such as C#, the *break* instruction is compulsory in the *case* clauses that are not empty, but this does not happen in Java, so we must take care of this situation.

```java
switch(number)
{
    case 0:	System.out.println("It is 0"); break;
    case 1: System.out.println("It is 1");
    case 2: System.out.println("It is 2"); break;
    default: System.out.println("Unknown number");
}
```

In previous example, if number is 1, it would output the messages "It is 1" and "It is 2", since there is no `break` clause at case 1.

    Create a program called **MarkCheck** that asks the user to enter 3 marks. The program must print one of these messages, depending on the mark values:
 
    * *All marks are greater or equal than 4*
    * *Some marks are not greater or equal than 4*
    * *No mark is greater or equal than 4*

!!! quote "Exercise 2"

    Create a program called **GramOunceConverter2** that will be an improved version of a previous exercise. In this case, the user will type a weight (float), and a unit (`g` for grams, `o` for ounces). Then, depending on the unit chosen, the program will convert the weight to the opposite unit. For instance, if the user types a weight of 33 and chooses `o` as unit, then the program must convert 33 ounces to grams. You must solve this program using a `switch` structure. If the unit is other than `g` or `o`, then the program must output an error message: "Unexpected unit", with no final result.

## 3. Additional exercises

Here you can find more additional exercises to practice with selective structures:

!!! quote "Additional exercise 1"

    Write a program that asks the user for their age. Use `if-else` statements to determine and display:

    - "Child" if the age is less than 13.
    - "Teenager" if the age is between 13 and 19.
    - "Adult" if the age is 20 or older.

!!! quote "Additional exercise 2"

    Write a program that takes three numbers as input from the user. Use `if-else` to find and display the largest number among them.

!!! quote "Additional exercise 3"

    Ask the user to enter a year. Use an `if-else` statement to determine if the year is a leap year or not. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

!!! quote "Additional exercise 4"

    Write a program that takes a single character input from the user. Use a `switch` statement to check whether the character is a vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) or a consonant. Handle both uppercase and lowercase characters.

!!! quote "Additional exercise 5"

    Ask the user to input two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). Use a `switch` statement to perform the corresponding arithmetic operation and display the result. Handle division by zero with an `if-else` check.

!!! quote "Additional exercise 6"

    Ask the user to input their grade as a percentage (0-100). Use `if-else` to determine and display:

    - "A" for grades 90 and above.
    - "B" for grades between 80 and 89.
    - "C" for grades between 70 and 79.
    - "D" for grades between 60 and 69.
    - "F" for grades below 60.

!!! quote "Additional exercise 7"

    Ask the user to input a number between 1 and 12 representing a month. Use a `switch` statement to print the number of days in that month. Consider February to have 28 days.

!!! quote "Additional exercise 8"

    Write a program that asks the user for a number. Use an `if-else` statement to check if the number is even or odd and display the result.

!!! quote "Additional exercise 9"

    Ask the user to input a color (`red`, `yellow`, or `green`). Use a `switch` statement to display:

    - "Stop" for red.
    - "Get Ready" for yellow.
    - "Go" for green.

    Handle invalid inputs with a default case.

!!! quote "Additional exercise 10"

    Ask the user for the current hour (0-23). Use `if-else` statements to determine:

    - "Morning" if the hour is between 5 and 11.
    - "Afternoon" if the hour is between 12 and 17.
    - "Evening" if the hour is between 18 and 21.
    - "Night" if the hour is between 22 and 4.
