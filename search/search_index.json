The correct sequence would be this one:</p> <pre><code>int number1 = sc.nextInt();\nint number2 = sc.nextInt();\nsc.nextLine(); \nString text = sc.nextLine();\n</code></pre> <p>Third line reads and discards the new line after number 43.</p>"},{"location":"01d.html#21-using-systemconsolereadline","title":"2.1.

You should use meaningful names for your variables. </p> <p>When reading the name of a variable (or any other element in the code), it must answer some basic questions, such as why it exists, what it does and how it is used. If a name requires a comment to explain its meaning, then it is not a suitable name. For instance, if we want to store in a variable the age average of a list of people, we should NOT do this:</p> <pre><code>int a;          // Age average\n</code></pre> <p>We could do this instead:</p> <pre><code>int ageAverage;\n</code></pre> <p>Some other aspects that we should take into account when dealing with variable names:</p> <ul> <li>Try not to use too similar names.

For instance, if a variable is named <code>account</code>, what does it mean? A user account? a bank account? It's better to be more specific, and call it <code>bankAccount</code>, for instance</li> <li>Choose one word per concept: if you declare many variables in many parts of your code to refer to a user login, you should always call them in the same way: <code>user</code>, or <code>login</code>, for instance, but don't change the name in each situation.</li> <li>Don't use short names, such as <code>n</code>, or <code>e</code>, because it will be difficult to find your variable among other similar words in the text.</li> <li>Try to use readable names.

For instance, if we declare two variables to store the name and age of a person, then we should place these declarations one after another, with no separations. This means that we should not add any comment that breaks the union:</li> </ul> <pre><code>String personName;\n/* \n * This comment should not be written here!\n */\nint personAge;\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Opening braces are put either at the end of the lines that need them (typical in programming languages such as Java or JavaScript) or at the beginning of the following line, with the same indentation than previous line (typical in programming languages such as C or C#). In this last case, they can act as blank lines of separation between blocks</li> </ul> <pre><code>// Java style (opening brace is NOT considered a blank line)\nif (condition) {\n    ...\n}\n\n// C# style (opening brace can be considered a blank line)\npublic static void Main()\n{\n    if (condition)\n    {\n        ...\n    }\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Regarding opening braces, you can decide which of these patterns you want to apply, but you must:</p> <ul> <li>Apply always the same pattern</li> <li>Use the same pattern than all the people in your team</li> </ul>"},{"location":"02d.html#32-horizontal-formatting","title":"3.2. Horizontal formatting","text":"<p>Regarding horizontal spacing or formatting, there are also some simple rules that we can follow.</p> <ul> <li>A line of code should be short (maybe 80 or 100 characters length, as much). Some IDEs show a vertical line (typically red) that sets the \"ideal\" limit for the length of each line. If it is going to be longer, we should cut it and divide the code in multiple lines. You can also apply other rules to determine the maximum line width: you should never have to scroll to the right to see your code, and it should be printable with the same appearance in a vertical page.</li> </ul> <pre><code>if ((personAge &gt; 18 &amp;&amp; personAge &lt;= 65) ||\n    (personName.equals(\"John\")) || (personName.equals(\"Mary\"))) \n{\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Horizontal spacing helps us associate things that are related, and disassociate things that are not. For instance, operators should be separated with a whitespace from the elements they are operating:</li> </ul> <pre><code>int average = (number1 + number2) / 2;\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Do not align the variable names vertically. It was very typical in old programming languages, such as assembly, but it makes no sense in modern programming languages, where there are lots of different data types. If you do this, you might tend to read the variable names without paying attention to their data types:</li> </ul> <pre><code>StringBuilder longText;\nint           textSize;\nString        textToFindAndReplace;\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>The indentation is important, since it establishes a hierarchy. There are elements that belong to the whole source file, and others that are part of a concrete block. Indentation help us determine the scope of a group of instructions. In this way:</li> <li>Class name is not indented</li> <li>Functions or other elements inside a class are indented one level</li> <li>Implementation of these functions are indented two levels</li> <li>Block implementations inside function code (code of if or while clauses, for instance) are indented three levels</li> <li>... etc.</li> </ul> <pre><code>public class MyClass \n{\n    public static void main(String[] args) \n    {\n        System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n        if (...) \n        {\n            System.out.println(\"Inside an if\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>"}]}
